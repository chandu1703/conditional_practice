Jsx:
writing HTML in Javascript is which is called JSX , as we write everything in js files in react.

Virtual Dom :
Virtual dom is a special feature in react . whenever we run our HTML , CSS , JS in web browsers a DOM is created and memory is allocated to it . If we make changes to our page , once again dom is created and memoory is allocated which results in memory waste and performance reduces . so virtual dom is the exact copy of real dom and other virtual dom is changes that have been made . both the virtual doms compared which is called diffing algorithm . The new changes were added to real dom which is called recoincillation
